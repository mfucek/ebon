# Ebon

Ebon is an easy to use yet robust framework for making virtual experiences, such as games.

Ebon is made to be used with Three.js and React out of the box, with (future) possibility of using other rendering libraries and frontend stacks.

<!-- We encourage you look at community made packages for Ebon. -->

Ebon is also compatible with and can make use of all the community libraries made for threejs and react.
